The model combines the information of the arrival of the patients onto the list and the process of donations, which also depend on the number of kidneys provided by each donor. Bayesian inference has been used to take into account the uncertainty about the parameters of the input distributions (acceptance, donation and transplantation rates). After validating the model, predictions about the future behaviour of the waiting list have been done. Results indicate a decrease in the size of the waiting list in a short and middle term. Comparison with other strategies of simulation has been done in order to confirm the problem of underestimation of the variance of the expected simulation output.},

We first study all the seven SES ‘domains’ separately using spatial hierarchical models to assess the level of underlying geographical structure in each of them. We then explore their joint relationships using a spatial factor model that extracts the information common and specific to the income, employment and education domains and regress the other domains on the extracted components. We use Bayesian inference throughout. Results show that all seven domains present strong spatial structure. The income, employment, education and health domains largely share the same information, which moderately overlaps with the crime and environment domains. The domain on access to services and housing is quite different from the others. The geographical patterns found in the latent common and specific factors are however difficult to interpret without further complementary information. Further investigation is required to identify plausible causal processes related to current economic and regional policies, and also to historic factors and their long-lasting socio-economic legacy.},

La distribución geográfica fue estudiada mediante la técnica geoestadística kriging, que permite estimar la incidencia de la enfermedad en cualquier punto del territorio, a partir de la incidencia observada en unos pocos puntos estratégicamente distribuidos. Se elaboraron mapas de curvas de isoincidencia de gripe para cada semana. La valoración de la técnica se realizó mediante validación cruzada. Resultados: En la mayoría de las semanas, los valores tanto de la desviación estándar (DE) reducida, como de la media reducida estuvieron cercanos a los valores considerados óptimos (0 o 1, respectivamente), y sólo en la última temporada se obtuvieron valores de la DE reducida alejados de los considerados como de buen ajuste en 12 de las 20 semanas. La estimación de tasas en todas las temporadas demostró una coherencia en su distribución espacial. También se observó coherencia en la evolución temporal. Conclusiones: En la mayoría de las situaciones los resultados pueden considerarse aceptables, no requiere recursos informáticos extraordinarios ni un empleo de tiempo excesivo, y necesita tan sólo una adaptación anual. Su facilidad de uso lo hace apto para su utilización como una técnica de rutina, pese a que puede mejorarse la precisión de las estimaciones, incrementando la complejidad del modelo},

La salud de estas poblaciones, medidas como riesgos de morbilidad o mortalidad, está condicionada por una gran variedad de factores de riesgo característicos de su región, como los medioambientales, que en ocasiones no se pueden medir. Los modelos de análisis espacial recogen la dependencia de los indicadores de salud entre regiones próximas provocada por la existencia de los factores de riesgo que éstas comparten pero que a veces no están medidos, de tal manera que la distribución espacial de los indicadores depende del patrón geográfico que siguen los factores de riesgo. En este trabajo se comentan algunas de las limitaciones que presentan los métodos de estandarización y la regresión de Poisson para modelar la espacialidad y se muestran las ventajas que aportan los modelos espaciales autorregresivos. Esta metodología se ilustra mediante los datos de incidencia de diabetes tipo 1 en Cataluña durante el período 1989-1998.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen an expansion in the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in environmental health research. In this field GIS can be used to detect disease clustering, to analyze access to hospital emergency care, to predict environmental outbreaks, and to estimate exposure to toxic compounds. Despite these advances the inability of GIS to properly handle temporal information is increasingly recognised as a significant constraint. The effective representation and visualization of both spatial and temporal dimensions therefore is expected to significantly enhance our ability to undertake environmental health research using time-referenced geospatial data. Especially for diseases with long latency periods (such as cancer) the ability to represent, quantify and model individual exposure through time is a critical component of risk estimation. In response to this need a STIS - a Space Time Information System has been developed to visualize and analyze objects simultaneously through space and time. RESULTS: In this paper we present a "first use" of a STIS in a case-control study of the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer in south eastern Michigan. Individual arsenic exposure is reconstructed by incorporating spatiotemporal data including residential mobility and drinking water habits. The unique contribution of the STIS is its ability to visualize and analyze residential histories over different temporal scales. Participant information is viewed and statistically analyzed using dynamic views in which values of an attribute change through time. These views include tables, graphs (such as histograms and scatterplots), and maps. In addition, these views can be linked and synchronized for complex data exploration using cartographic brushing, statistical brushing, and animation. CONCLUSION: The STIS provides new and powerful ways to visualize and analyze how individual exposure and associated environmental variables change through time. We expect to see innovative space-time methods being utilized in future environmental health research now that the successful "first use" of a STIS in exposure reconstruction has been accomplished.},

Some existing ad hoc methods for model checking (quadrat counts, scan statistic, kernel smoothed intensity and Berman’s diagnostic) are recovered as special cases. Diagnostic tools are developed systematically, by using an analogy between our spatial residuals and the usual residuals for (non-spatial) generalized linear models.The conditional intensity ? plays the role of the mean response. This makes it possible to adapt existing knowledge about model validation for generalized linear models to the spatial point process context, giving recommendations for diagnostic plots. A plot of smoothed residuals against spatial location, or against a spatial covariate, is effective in diagnosing spatial trend or covariate effects. Q–Q-plots of the residuals are effective in diagnosing interpoint interaction.},

In doing so,methods are described in outline, rather than in mathematical depth,and the focus is on selection of commonly used techniques in each of the areas discussed, rather than on attempting to exhaustively cover all possible methods and models. Extensive references are provided to further details about the methods discussed and to additional approaches mentioned in passing.The overall aim is to provide picture of the ‘current state of the art ’in the use of spatial statistical methods in epidemiological and public health research. Following the review of methods,the main software environments which are available to implement such methods in practice are brie?y discussed. The paper then concludes with some brief general re?ections on the epidemiological and public health implications of the use of spatial statistical methods in health and on associated bene?ts and problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent developments in GIS have encouraged health science databases to incorporate geographical information about the subjects under study. Such databases have in turn generated interest among statisticians to develop and analyze models that account for spatial clustering and variation. In this article we develop a semiparametric (Cox) hierarchical Bayesian frailty model for capturing spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the survival patterns of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Iowa. In the absence of appropriate surrogates for standards of treatments and health care for cancer patients in the different counties, epidemiologists and health-care professionals are interested in discerning spatial patterns in survival from breast cancer that might be present among the counties. In addition, it is naturally of interest to see if the counties show discernible temporal trends over the years. The SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provides data on a cohort of breast cancer patients observed progressively through time, spanning 26 years. We implement our hierarchical spatio-temporal models on data extracted from the database for the 99 counties of Iowa. Our results suggest log-relative hazards that are generally flat initially, but steadily decrease for more recent years. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Several recent papers (e.g., Chen, Ibrahim, and Sinha, 1999, Journal of the American Statistical Association94, 909-919; Ibrahim, Chen, and Sinha, 2001a, Biometrics57, 383-388) have described statistical methods for use with time-to-event data featuring a surviving fraction (i.e., a proportion of the population that never experiences the event). Such cure rate models and their multivariate generalizations are quite useful in studies of multiple diseases to which an individual may never succumb, or from which an individual may reasonably be expected to recover following treatment (e.g., various types of cancer). In this article we extend these models to allow for spatial correlation (estimable via zip code identifiers for the subjects) as well as interval censoring. Our approach is Bayesian, where posterior summaries are obtained via a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare across a broad collection of rather high-dimensional hierarchical models using the deviance information criterion, a tool recently developed for just this purpose. We apply our approach to the analysis of a smoking cessation study where the subjects reside in 53 southeastern Minnesota zip codes. In addition to the usual posterior estimates, our approach yields smoothed zip code level maps of model parameters related to the relapse rates over time and the ultimate proportion of quitters (the cure rates).},

  Abstract                 = {The use of survival models involving a random effect or 'frailty' term is becoming more common. Usually the random effects are assumed to represent different clusters, and clusters are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we consider random effects corresponding to clusters that are spatially arranged, such as clinical sites or geographical regions. That is, we might suspect that random effects corresponding to strata in closer proximity to each other might also be similar in magnitude. Such spatial arrangement of the strata can be modeled in several ways, but we group these ways into two general settings: geostatistical approaches, where we use the exact geographic locations (e.g. latitude and longitude) of the strata, and lattice approaches, where we use only the positions of the strata relative to each other (e.g. which counties neighbor which others). We compare our approaches in the context of a dataset on infant mortality in Minnesota counties between 1992 and 1996. Our main substantive goal here is to explain the pattern of infant mortality using important covariates (sex, race, birth weight, age of mother, etc.) while accounting for possible (spatially correlated) differences in hazard among the counties. We use the GIS ArcView to map resulting fitted hazard rates, to help search for possible lingering spatial correlation. The DIC criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 2002, to appear) is used to choose among various competing models. We investigate the quality of fit of our chosen model, and compare its results when used to investigate neonatal versus post-neonatal mortality. We also compare use of our time-to-event outcome survival model with the simpler dichotomous outcome logistic model. Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest directions for future research.},

The paper makes three distinct contributions. First, we enforce the stationarity conditions using a very efficient Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to generate the partial autocorrelations. Second we show how to carry out the Gibbs sampler when the autoregressive order is unknown. Third, we show how to combine the various aspects of fitting an autoregressive model giving a more comprehensive and efficient treatment than previous work. We illustrate our methodology with a real example.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of variation of risk for a given disease in space and time is a key issue in descriptive epidemiology. When the data are scarce, maximum likelihood estimates of the area-specific risk and of its linear time-trend can be seriously affected by random variation. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model in which both area-specific intercept and trend are modelled as random effects and correlation between them is allowed for. This model is an extension of that originally proposed for disease mapping. It is illustrated by the analysis of the cumulative prevalence of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as observed at the military examination of 18-year-old conscripts born in Sardinia during the period 1936-1971. Data concerning the genetic differentiation of the Sardinian population are used to interpret the results.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological regression studies are widely used to examine relationships between dis- ease rates for small geographical areas and exposure to environmental risk factors. The raw data for such studies, including disease cases, environmental pollution con- centrations and the reference population at risk, are typically measured at a variety of levels of spatial aggregation but are accumulated to a common geographical scale to facilitate statistical analysis. In this traditional approach heterogeneous exposure distributions within the aggregate areas may lead to biased inference, while individ- ual attributes such as age, gender and smoking habits must either be summarized to provide area level covariate values or used to stratify the analysis. This paper presents a spatial regression analysis of the e ect of trac pollution on respiratory disorders in children. The analysis features data measured at disparate, non-nested scales, including spatially varying covariates, latent spatially varying risk factors, and case-speci c individual attributes. The problem of disparate discretizations is overcome by relating all spatially varying quantities to a continuous underlying random eld model. Case-speci c individual attributes are accommodated by treating cases as a marked point process. Inference in these hierarchical Poisson/gamma models is based on simulated samples drawn from Bayesian posterior distributions, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with data augmentation.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of routine health data indexed at a fine geographical resolution, small area disease mapping studies have become an established technique in geographical epidemiology. The specific issues posed by the sparseness of the data and possibility for local spatial dependence belong to a generic class of statistical problems involving an underlying (latent) spatial process of interest corrupted by observational noise. These are naturally formulated within the framework of hierarchical models, and over the past decade, a variety of spatial models have been proposed for the latent level(s) of the hierarchy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main classes of such models that have been used for disease mapping within a Bayesian estimation paradigm, and report a performance comparison between representative models in these classes, using a set of simulated data to help illustrate their respective properties. We also consider recent extensions to model the joint spatial distribution of multiple disease or health indicators. The aim is to help the reader choose an appropriate structural prior for the second level of the hierarchical model and to discuss issues of sensitivity to this choice.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the standard technology in human brain mapping. Analyses of the massive spatio-temporal fMRI data sets often focus on parametric or nonparametric modeling of the temporal component, while spatial smoothing is based on Gaussian kernels or random fields. A weakness of Gaussian spatial smoothing is underestimation of activation peaks or blurring of high-curvature transitions between activated and non-activated brain regions. In this paper, we introduce a class of inhomogeneous Markov random fields (MRF) with spatially adaptive interaction weights in a space-varying coeficient model for fMRI data. For given weights, the random field is conditionally Gaussian, but marginally it is non-Gaussian. Fully Bayesian inference, including estimation of weights and variance parameters, is carried out through eficient MCMC simulation. An application to fMRI data from a visual stimulation experiment demonstrates the performance of our approach in comparison to Gaussian and robustified non-Gaussian Markov random field models.},

  Abstract                 = {The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as a computer-intensive statistical tool, has enjoyed an enormous upsurge in interest over the last few years. This paper provides a simple, comprehensive and tutorial review of some of the most common areas of research in this field. We begin by discussing how MCMC algorithms can be constructed from standard buildingblocks to produce Markov chains with the desired stationary distribution. We also motivate and discuss more complex ideas that have been proposed in the literature, such as continuous time and dimension jumping methods. We discuss some implementational issues associated with MCMC methods. We take a look at the arguments for and against multiple replications, consider how long chains should be run for and how to determine suitable starting points. We also take a look at graphical models and how graphical approaches can be used to simplify MCMC implementation. Finally, we present a couple of examples, which we use as case-studies to highlight some of the points made earlier in the text. In particular, we use a simple changepoint model to illustrate how to tackle a typical Bayesian modelling problem via the MCMC method, before using mixture model problems to provide illustrations of good sampler output and of the implementation of a reversible jump MCMC algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical space-time modelling has traditionally been concerned with separable covariance functions, meaning that the covariance function is a product of a purely temporal function and a purely spatial function. We draw attention to a physical dispersion model which could model phenomena such as the spread of an air pollutant. We show that this model has a non-separable covariance function. The model is well suited to a wide range of realistic problems which will be poorly fitted by separable models. The model operates successively in time: the spatial field at time t + 1 is obtained by 'blurring' the field at time t and adding a spatial random field. The model is first introduced at discrete time steps, and the limit is taken as the length of the time steps goes to 0. This gives a consistent continuous model with parameters that are interpretable in continuous space and independent of sampling intervals. Under certain conditions the blurring must be a Gaussian smoothing kernel. We also show that the model is generated by a stochastic differential equation which has been studied by several researchers previously.},

Various Metropolis–Hastings algorithms have been suggested that make use of previously sampled states in defining an adaptive proposal density. Here we propose a general class of adaptive Metropolis–Hastings algorithms based on Metropolis–Hastings-within-Gibbs sampling. For the case of a one-dimensional target distribution, we present two novel algorithms using mixtures of triangular and trapezoidal densities. These can also be seen as improved versions of the all-purpose adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (ARMS) algorithm to sample from non-logconcave univariate densities. Using various different examples, we demonstrate their properties and efficiencies and point out their advantages over ARMS and other adaptive alternatives such as the Normal Kernel Coupler.},

Very often these data will be grouped into strata, such as clinical sites, geographic regions, and so on. Such data will often be available over multiple time periods, and for multiple diseases. In this paper, we consider hierarchical spatial process models for multivariate survival data sets which are spatio-temporally arranged. Such models must account for correlations between survival rates in neighboring spatial regions, adjacent time periods, and similar diseases (say, different forms of cancer). We investigate Cox semiparametric survival modeling approaches, adding spatial and temporal effects in a hierarchical structure. Due to data limitations and computational complexity issues, we avoid geostatistical (kriging) models, and instead handle spatial correlation by placing a particular multivariate generalization of the conditionally autoregressive (CAR) distribution on the region-specific frailties. Exemplification is provided using time-to-event data for various cancers from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.},

Applied statisticians who are new to these methods may have several questions and concerns, however: How much effort and expertise are needed to design and use a Markov chain sampler? How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various "tricks of the trade." This article is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC -and to not so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding and assessing convergence, estimating standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of rates from disease registers are often reported inadequately because of too coarse tabulation of data and because of confusion about the mechanics of the age–period–cohort model used for analysis. Rates should be considered as observations in a Lexis diagram, and tabulation a necessary reduction of data, which should be as small as possible, and age, period and cohort should be treated as continuous variables. Reporting should include the absolute level of the rates as part of the age-effects. This paper gives a guide to analysis of rates from a Lexis diagram by the age–period–cohort model. Three aspects are considered separately: (1) tabulation of cases and person-years; (2) modelling of age, period and cohort effects; and (3) parametrization and reporting of the estimated effects. It is argued that most of the confusion in the literature comes from failure to make a clear distinction between these three aspects. A set of recommendations for the practitioner is given and a package for R that implements the recommendations is introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Spatial clustering of different diseases has received much less attention than single disease mapping. Besides chance or artifact, clustering of different cancers in a given area may depend on exposure to a shared risk factor or to multiple correlated factors (e.g. cigarette smoking and obesity in a deprived area). Models developed so far to investigate co-occurrence of diseases are not wellsuited for analyzing many cancers simultaneously. In this paper we propose a simple two-step exploratory method for screening clusters of different cancers in a population. Methods Cancer incidence data were derived from the regional cancer registry of Umbria, Italy. A cluster analysis was performed on smoothed and non-smoothed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of the 13 most frequent cancers in males. The Besag, York and Mollie model (BYM) and Poisson kriging were used to produce smoothed SIRs. Results Cluster analysis on non-smoothed SIRs was poorly informative in terms of clustering of different cancers, as only larynx and oral cavity were grouped, and of characteristic patterns of cancer incidence in specific geographical areas. On the other hand BYM and Poisson kriging gave similar results, showing cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, stomach and liver formed a main cluster. Lung and urinary bladder cancers clustered together but not with the cancers mentioned above. Both methods, particularly the BYM model, identified distinct geographic clusters of adjacent areas. Conclusion As in single disease mapping, non-smoothed SIRs do not provide reliable estimates of cancer risks because of small area variability. The BYM model produces smooth risk surfaces which, when entered into a cluster analysis, identify well-defined geographical clusters of adjacent areas. It probably enhances or amplifies the signal arising from exposure of more areas (statistical units) to shared risk factors that are associated with different cancers. In Umbria the main clusters were characterized by high risks for cancers with alcohol and tobacco both as risk factors. Tobacco-only related cancers formed a separate cluster to the alcohol- and tobacco- related sites. Joint spatial analysis or investigation of hypothesized exposures might be used for further investigation into interesting geographical clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {In the analysis of spatial point patterns it is generally assumed that the underlying spatial point process is isotropic i.e. that all characteristics are homogeneous with respect to direction. However this is known in many applications not to be the case. For example the distribution of plant seedling locations often exhibits directional asymmetry or anisotropy due to factors such as prevailing wind direction and systematic migratory behavior of seed carriers. Failure to account for such directional inhomogeneity can result in erroneous inferences. A special type of spatial point process is considered, namely the dimensional Poisson cluster process with bivariate normal offspring dispersal BVNPCP. Estimation of the parameters of a BVNPCP (the focus being "the cluster shape/scale parameter," the covariance matrix of the offspring dispersal distribution) is particularly challenging due to the substantial amount of latent data. The offspring relationships, number of parents and locations of parents are all unknown. Two approaches for testing for and estimating anisotropy are developed and applied to a collection of actual and simulated spatial point patterns. The first approach considers the BVNPCP as a finite mixture model and combines EM algorithm parameter estimates, computed separately for different numbers of clusters, in a Bayesian model averaging type scheme. A "composite EM" estimator of the cluster shape/scale parameter is thus constructed, along with an estimated asymptotic variance computed from a combination of observed information matrices. In the second approach, a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) technique for 2-dimensional normal mixtures is developed. RJMCMC extends the traditional MCMC capabilities by providing for transitions between different parameter spaces, which are needed in our situation due to the unknown number of clusters. A new convergence assessment method, applicable to any RJMCMC situation in which distinct models can be identiffied, is designed and theoretically justiffied. Output analysis methods are also developed, including anisotropy testing, estimation, model checking and inference for number of clusters. The RJMCMC technique is flexible and has potential to apply to more complicated spatial point processes, and also other mixture related problems.},

  Abstract                 = {For rare diseases the observed disease count may exhibit extra Poisson variability, particularly in areas with low or sparse populations. Hence the variance of the estimates of disease risk, the standardized mortality ratios, may be highly unstable. This overdispersion must be taken into account otherwise subsequent maps based on standardized mortality ratios will be misleading and, rather than displaying the true spatial pattern of disease risk, the most extreme values will be highlighted. Neighbouring areas tend to exhibit spatial correlation as they may share more similarities than non-neighbouring areas. The need to address overdispersion and spatial correlation has led to the proposal of Bayesian approaches for smoothing estimates of disease risk.We propose a new model for investigating the spatial variation of disease risks in conjunction with an alternative specification for estimates of disease risk in geographical areas—the multivariate Poisson–gamma model. The main advantages of this new model lie in its simplicity and ability to account naturally for overdispersion and spatial auto-correlation. Exact expressions for important quantities such as expectations, variances and covariances can be easily derived.},

We present a general model that incorporates spatial correlation and potential lagged or shifted dependencies and that can represent subject matter theory or serve as a practical exploratory model. Procedures for model ? tting, parameter estimation, inferences, and latent variable prediction are developed without restrictive assumptions on distribution and covariance function forms. The properties and usefulness of the proposed approaches are assessed by asymptotic theory and an extensive simulation study. An example from precision agriculture is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Different priors have been suggested to reflect spatial dependence in area health outcomes or in spatial regression residuals. However, to assume that residuals demonstrate spatial clustering only is a strong prior belief and alternatives have been suggested. A scheme suggested by Leroux et al. [B. Leroux, X. Lei, N. Breslow, Estimation of disease rates in small areas: A new mixed model for spatial dependence, in: M. Halloran, D. Berry (Eds.), Statistical Models in Epidemiology, the Environment and Clinical Trials, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1999, pp. 135–178] involves a single set of random effects and a spatial correlation parameter with extreme values corresponding to pure spatial and pure unstructured residual variation. This paper considers a spatially adaptive extension of that prior to reflect the fact that the appropriate mix between local and global smoothing may not be constant across the region being studied. Local smoothing will not be indicated when an area is disparate from its neighbours (e.g. in terms of social or environmental risk factors for the health outcome being considered). The prior for varying spatial correlation parameters may be based on a regression structure which includes possible observed sources of disparity between neighbours. A case study considers probabilities of long term illness in 133 small areas in NE London, with disparities based on a measure of socio-economic deprivation.},

This case study aims to estimate the effect of area of residence on waiting times to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and to assess the role of important individual specific covariates (age, sex and disease severity). The data involved all patients with definite coronary artery disease who were referred to one cardiothoracic unit from five contiguous health authorities covering 488 electoral wards (areas). Time to event was the waiting time in months from angiography (diagnosis) to CABG (event). A number of discrete time survival models were fitted to the data. A discrete baseline hazard was estimated by fitting waiting time non-parametrically into the models. Ward was fitted as a spatial effect using a Gaussian Markov random field prior. Individual specific covariates considered were age, sex and number of diseased vessels. The recently proposed DIC criteria was used for comparing models. Results showed a marked spatial effect on time to bypass surgery after including age, sex and disease severity in the model. Notably this spatial effect was not apparent when these covariates were not included in the model. The observed small area spatial variation in time to CABG warrants further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis introduces novel nonparametric Bayesian regression methods and utilises modern Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC techniques to explore the posterior distributions of interest induced by the models. Traditional nonparametric regression approaches fit models using so called greedy algorithms which minimise some lack of fit criterion at each step. The algorithms are commonly divided into two parts: forward stepwise addition and backwards deletion. We demonstrate how by setting up a probability distribution over both the number and form of the basis functions we can improve on the greedy approach in terms of prediction and have more information to aid interpretation of the model as well. After an introduction describing both Bayesian and non Bayesian regression models we start by Bayesian curve fitting with various noise structures. The methodology is extended to perform spectral estimation in Chapter 3 and then multiple regression is considered in detail in Chapters 4 and 5. We introduce Bayesian versions of the classification and regression tree (CART) and the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) algorithms. The Bayesian MARS model is then utilised in a variety of applications from nonlinear time series and financial data in Chapter5, to survival analysis with and without frailties in Chapter 6.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model is widely used in many small-area ecological studies to analyse outcomes measured at an areal level. There has been little evaluation of the influence of different neighbourhood weight matrix structures on the amount of smoothing performed by the CAR model. We examined this issue in detail. Methods We created several neighbourhood weight matrices and applied them to a large dataset of births and birth defects in New South Wales (NSW), Australia within 198 Statistical Local Areas. Between the years 1995-2003, there were 17,595 geocoded birth defects and 770,638 geocoded birth records with available data. Spatio-temporal models were developed with data from 1995-2000 and their fit evaluated within the following time period: 2001-2003. Results We were able to create four adjacency-based weight matrices, seven distance-based weight matrices and one matrix based on similarity in terms of a key covariate (i.e. maternal age). In terms of agreement between observed and predicted relative risks, categorised in epidemiologically relevant groups, generally the distance-based matrices performed better than the adjacency-based neighbourhoods. In terms of recovering the underlying risk structure, the weight-7 model (smoothing by maternal-age 'Covariate model') was able to correctly classify 35/47 high-risk areas (sensitivity 74%) with a specificity of 47%, and the 'Gravity' model had sensitivity and specificity values of 74% and 39% respectively. Conclusion We found considerable differences in the smoothing properties of the CAR model, depending on the type of neighbours specified. This in turn had an effect on the models' ability to recover the observed risk in an area. Prior to risk mapping or ecological modelling, an exploratory analysis of the neighbourhood weight matrix to guide the choice of a suitable weight matrix is recommended. Alternatively, the weight matrix can be chosen a priori based on decision-theoretic considerations including loss, cost and inferential aims.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously published scientific papers have reported a negative correlation between drinking water hardness and cardiovascular mortality. Some ecologic and case-control studies suggest the protective effect of calcium and magnesium concentration in drinking water. In this article we present an analysis of this protective relationship in 538 municipalities of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) from 1991-1998. We used the Spanish version of the Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) developed under the European Environment and Health Information System (EUROHEIS) research project. The strategy of analysis used in our study conforms to the exploratory nature of the RIF that is used as a tool to obtain quick and flexible insight into epidemiologic surveillance problems. This article describes the use of the RIF to explore possible associations between disease indicators and environmental factors. We used exposure analysis to assess the effect of both protective factors--calcium and magnesium--on mortality from cerebrovascular (ICD-9 430-438) and ischemic heart (ICD-9 410-414) diseases. This study provides statistical evidence of the relationship between mortality from cardiovascular diseases and hardness of drinking water. This relationship is stronger in cerebrovascular disease than in ischemic heart disease, is more pronounced for women than for men, and is more apparent with magnesium than with calcium concentration levels. Nevertheless, the protective nature of these two factors is not clearly established. Our results suggest the possibility of protectiveness but cannot be claimed as conclusive. The weak effects of these covariates make it difficult to separate them from the influence of socioeconomic and environmental factors. We have also performed disease mapping of standardized mortality ratios to detect clusters of municipalities with high risk. Further standardization by levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water shows changes in the maps when we remove the effect of these covariates.},

  Abstract                 = {The statistical detection of environmental risk factors in public health studies is usually difficult due to the weakness of their effects and their confounding with other covariates. Small area geographical data bring the opportunity of observing health response in a wide variety of exposure values. Temporal sequences of these geographical datasets are crucial to gaining statistical power in detecting factors.The spatiotemporal models required to perform the statistical analysis have to allow for spatial and temporal correlations, which are more easily modelled via hierarchical structures of hidden random factors. These models have produced important research activity during the last decade, the most promising line being Bayesian analysis via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Practical issues without a clear answer still remain. Model comparison is one of those with the most practical relevance.In this article we perform the analysis of hierarchical spatiotemporal models to evaluate the protective effect of calcium and magnesium in drinking water against cerebrovascular mortality. Our data register yearly mortality counts from 1990 to 1995 in a municipality scale but we are not sure which temporal aggregation would be adequate. Many small counts might introduce computational artifacts, leading to inaccurate conclusions. We compare hierarchical models of diverse structure for different temporal aggregation settings via pseudo-Bayes factor and deviance information criteria. We carry out a sensitivity analysis of our main conclusions to ascertain their validity independently of the arbitrary degree of data aggregation and model structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Gaussian Markov random ?elds (GMRF) are important families of distributions for the modeling of spatial data and have been extensively used in different areas of spatial statistics such as disease mapping, image analysis and remote sensing. GMRFs have been used for the modeling of spatial data, both as models for the sampling distribution of the observed data and as models for the prior of latent processes/random effects; we consider mainly the former use of GMRFs. We study a large class of GMRF models that includes several models previously proposed in the literature. An objectiv Bayesian analysis is presented for the parameters of the abov class of GMRFs, where explicit expressions for the Jeffreys (two versions) and reference priors are derived, and for each of these priors results on posterior propriety of the model parameters are established. We describe a simple MCMCalgorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, and study frequentist properties of the Bayesian inferences resulting from the use of these automatic priors. Finally,we illustrate the use of the proposed GMRF model and reference prior for studying the spatial variability of lip cancer cases in the districts of Scotland over the period 1975 –1980.},

This is the case for the variable selection problem with a moderately large number of possible explanatory variables considered in this article. We review some of the strategies proposed in the literature, from a theoretical point of view using arguments of sampling theory and in practical terms using several examples with a known answer. All our results seem to indicate that sampling methods with frequency-based estimators outperform searching methods with renormalized estimators.

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent “statistic” or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a chi-squared or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Small area estimation is becoming important in survey Sampling due to a growing demand for reliable small area statistics from both public and private sectors. It is now widely recognized that direct survey estimates for small areas are likely to yield unacceptably large standard errors due to the smallness of sample sizes in the areas. This makes it necessary to "borrow strength" from related areas to find more accurate estimates for a given area or, simultaneously, for several areas. This has led to the development of alternative methods such as synthetic, sample size dependent, empirical best linear unbiased prediction, empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes estimation. The present article is largely an appraisal of some of these methods. The performance of these methods is also evaluated using some synthetic data resembling a business population. Empirical best linear unbiased prediction as well as empirical and hierarchical Bayes, for most purposes, seem to have a distinct advantage over other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Age-period-cohort models are usually used in descriptive epidemiological studies to analyze time trends in incidence or mortality. The exact linear relationship between the three effects of these models has the effect of making the parameters of the full model impossible to estimate, which is called non-identifiability. In these notes two of the most frequently used methods to analyze age-period-cohort models will be explained. One is based on penalty functions and the other on estimable functions (drift and curvatures or deviation from linearity). Both methods will be illustrated with two examples in wich temporal trends of breast and lung cancer mortality in women from Catalonia in Spain will be studied. These examples show how the methods based on penalty functions tend to attribute the trend exclusively to a cohort effect. Consequently, the use of methods based on estimate functions is recommended.},

They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This article proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Relative survival rates are among the most commonly reported outcome measures of cancer patients. They are calculated as ratios of observed survival rates and the expected survival rates in the absence of cancer. Standard errors of relative survival rates are commonly calculated by dividing the standard error for absolute survival rates by the expected survival, without taking possible random variation of the latter into account. The aim of this study was to empirically assess the validity of these commonly reported standard errors. Using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry, the authors calculated 5- and 10-year absolute, expected, and relative survival rates for patients with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989. The authors used bootstrap analysis to empirically assess the random error of absolute and relative survival rates and then compared the results with conventionally derived estimates of standard errors. The conventional and bootstrap standard errors were closely similar for all estimates of absolute survival. By contrast, the conventional estimates of standard errors of 5- and 10-year relative survival exceeded the bootstrap estimates by up to 17% and 32%, respectively. The authors conclude that conventional derivation may substantially overestimate standard errors for relative survival.},

METHODS: Data were drawn from the WEB study (Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer Study), a population-based case-control study of incident, pathologically confirmed breast cancer (1996-2001) in Erie and Niagara counties. Controls were frequency-matched to cases on age, race, and county of residence. All cases and controls used in the study provided lifetime residential histories. The k-function difference between cases and controls was used to identify spatial clustering patterns of residence in early life. RESULTS: We found that the evidence for clustered residences at birth and at menarche was stronger than that for first birth or other time periods in adult life. Residences for pre-menopausal cases were more clustered than for controls at the time of birth and menarche. We also identified the size and geographic location of birth and menarche clusters in the study area, and found increased breast cancer risk for pre-menopausal women whose residence was within the cluster compared to those living elsewhere at the time of birth. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that early environmental exposures may be related to breast cancer risk, especially for pre-menopausal women.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Most analyses of spatial clustering of disease have been based on either residence at the time of diagnosis or current residence. An underlying assumption in these analyses is that residence can be used as a proxy for environmental exposure. However, exposures earlier in life and not just those in the most recent period may be of significance. In breast cancer, there is accumulating evidence that early life exposures may contribute to risk. We explored spatio-temporal patterns of risk surfaces using data on lifetime residential history in a case control study of breast cancer, and identified elevated areas of risk and areas potentially having more exposure opportunities, defined as risk surfaces in this study. This approach may be more relevant in understanding the environmental etiology of breast cancer, since lifetime cumulative exposures or exposures at critical times may be more strongly associated with risk for breast cancer than exposures from the recent period. RESULTS: A GIS-based exploratory spatial analysis was applied, and spatio-temporal variability of those risk surfaces was evaluated using the standardized difference in density surfaces between cases and controls. The significance of the resulting risk surfaces was tested and reported as p-values. These surfaces were compared for premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and were obtained for each decade, from the 1940s to 1990s. We found strong evidence of clustering of lifetime residence for premenopausal women (for cases relative to controls), and a less strong suggestion of such clustering for postmenopausal women, and identified a substantial degree of temporal variability of the risk surfaces. CONCLUSION: We were able to pinpoint geographic areas with higher risk through exploratory spatial analyses, and to assess temporal variability of the risk surfaces, thus providing a working hypothesis on breast cancer and environmental exposures. Geographic areas with higher case densities need further epidemiologic investigation for potential relationships between lifetime environmental exposures and breast cancer risk. Examination of lifetime residential history provided additional information on geographic areas associated with higher risk; limiting exploration of chronic disease clustering to current residence may neglect important relationships between location and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {A continuous spatial model can be constructed by convolving a very simple, perhaps independent, process with a kernel or point spread function. This approach for constructing a spatial process offers a number of advantages over specification through a spatial covariogram. In particular, this process convolution specification leads to compuational simplifications and easily extends beyond simple stationary models. This paper uses process convolution models to build space and space-time models that are flexible and able to accomodate large amounts of data. Data from environmental monitoring is considered.},

  Abstract                 = {In models for vital rates which include effects due to age, period and cohort, there is aliasing due to a linear dependence among these three factors. This dependence arises both when age and period intervals are equal and when they are not. One solution to the dependence is to set an arbitrary constraint on the parameters. Estimable functions of the parameters are invariant to the particular constraint applied. For evenly spaced intervals, deviations from linearity are estimable but only a linear function of the three slopes is estimable. When age and period intervals have different widths, further aliasing occurs. It is assumed that the number of deaths in the numerator of the rate equation has a Poisson distribution. The calculations are illustrated with data on mortality from prostate cancer among nonwhites in the U.S.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearest neighbour algorithms are among the most popular methods used in statistical pattern recognition. The models are conceptually simple and empirical studies have shown that their performance is highly competitive against other techniques. However, the lack of a formal framework for choosing the size of the neighbourhood k is problematic. Furthermore, the method can only make discrete predictions by reporting the relative frequency of the classes in the neighbourhood of the prediction point. We present a probabilistic framework for the k-nearest-neighbour method that largely overcomes these difficulties. Uncertainty is accommodated via a prior distribution on k as well as in the strength of the interaction between neighbours. These prior distributions propagate uncertainty through to proper probabilistic predictions that have continuous support on (0, 1). The method makes no assumptions about the distribution of the predictor variables. The method is also fully automatic with no user-set parameters and empirically it proves to be highly accurate on many bench-mark data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {In a wide range of applications, dependence on smoothly-varying covariates leads spatial point count intensities to feature positive correlation for nearby locations. In applications where the points are “marked” with individual attributes, the distributions for points with varying attributes may also differ. We introduce a class of hierarchical spatial regression models for relating marked point process intensi-ties to location-specific covariates and to individual-specific attributes, and for modeling the remaining intensity variation that arises from dependence on unobserved or unreported covariates. The magnitude of residual intensity variation is a measure of how completely the covariates explain the observed varia-tions in point intensities. The models, extending those recently introduced by Wolpert and Ickstadt, treat the point patterns as doubly-stochastic Poisson random fields with a random inhomogeneous Poisson intensity given by a spatial mixture of gamma or other infinitely-divisible independent-increment ran-dom fields. Bayesian prior distributions for a third level of hierarchy are elicited to reflect beliefs about the homogeneity, continuity, and similar features of the intensity. Inference is based on posterior and predictive distributions computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods featuring data augmenta-tion and an efficient method for sampling from independent-increment random fields. The models are illustrated in an application to a four-dimensional spatial regression analysis of origin/destination trip data from the 1994/95 Metro survey of Portland, Oregon.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: This paper introduces a new approach for evaluating clustering in case-control data that accounts for residential histories. Although many statistics have been proposed for assessing local, focused and global clustering in health outcomes, few, if any, exist for evaluating clusters when individuals are mobile. METHODS: Local, global and focused tests for residential histories are developed based on sets of matrices of nearest neighbor relationships that reflect the changing topology of cases and controls. Exposure traces are defined that account for the latency between exposure and disease manifestation, and that use exposure windows whose duration may vary. Several of the methods so derived are applied to evaluate clustering of residential histories in a case-control study of bladder cancer in south eastern Michigan. These data are still being collected and the analysis is conducted for demonstration purposes only. RESULTS: Statistically significant clustering of residential histories of cases was found but is likely due to delayed reporting of cases by one of the hospitals participating in the study. CONCLUSION: Data with residential histories are preferable when causative exposures and disease latencies occur on a long enough time span that human mobility matters. To analyze such data, methods are needed that take residential histories into account.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a unified framework for a Bayesian analysis of incidence or mortality data in space and time. We introduce four different types of prior distributions for spaceXtime interaction in extension of a model with only main effects. Each type implies a certain degree of prior dependence for the interaction parameters, and corresponds to the product of one of the two spatial with one of the two temporal main effects. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968-1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance. Our results confirm an epidemiological hypothesis about the temporal development of the association between urbanization and risk factors for cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Disease incidence or mortality data are typically available as rates or counts for specified regions, collected over time. We propose Bayesian nonparametric spatial modeling approaches to analyze such data. We develop a hierarchical specification using spatial random effects modeled with a Dirichlet process prior. The Dirichlet process is centered around a multivariate normal distribution. This latter distribution arises from a log-Gaussian process model that provides a latent incidence rate surface, followed by block averaging to the areal units determined by the regions in the study. With regard to the resulting posterior predictive inference, the modeling approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach based on block averaging of a spatial Dirichlet process to obtain a prior probability model for the finite dimensional distribution of the spatial random effects. We introduce a dynamic formulation for the spatial random effects to extend the model to spatio-temporal settings. Posterior inference is implemented through Gibbs sampling. We illustrate the methodology with simulated data as well as with a data set on lung cancer incidences for all 88 counties in the state of Ohio over an observation period of 21 years.},

  Abstract                 = {Joint modelling of space and time variation of the risk of disease is an important topic in descriptive epidemiology. Most of the proposals in this field deal with at most two time scales (age–period or age–cohort). We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that can be used as a general framework to jointly study the evolution in time and the spatial pattern of the risk of disease. The rates are modelled as a function of purely spatial terms (local effects of risk factors that do not vary in time), time effects (on the three time axes: age, calendar period and birth cohort) and space–time interactions that describe area specific time patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Gaussian processes (GP) have proven to be useful and versatile stochastic models in a wide variety of applications including computer experiments, environmental monitoring, hydrology and climate modeling. A GP model is determined by its mean and covariance functions. In most cases, the mean is specified to be a constant, or some other simple linear function, whereas the covariance function is governed by a few parameters. A Bayesian formulation is attractive as it allows for formal incorporation of uncertainty regarding the parameters governing the GP. However, estimation of these parameters can be problematic. Large datasets, posterior correlation and inverse problems can all lead to difficulties in exploring the posterior distribution. Here, we propose an alternative model which is quite tractable computationally – even with large datasets or indirectly observed data – while still maintaining the flexibility and adaptiveness of traditional GP models. This model is based on convolving simple Markov random fields with a smoothing kernel. We consider applications in hydrology and aircraft prototype testing.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new class of semiparametric frailty models for spatially correlated survival data. Specifically, we extend the ordinary frailty models by allowing random effects accommodating spatial correlations to enter into the baseline hazard function multiplicatively. We prove identifiability of the models and give sufficient regularity conditions. We propose drawing inference based on a marginal rank likelihood. No parametric forms of the baseline hazard need to be assumed in this semiparametric approach. Monte Carlo simulations and the Laplace approach are used to tackle the intractable integral in the likelihood function. Different spatial covariance structures are explored in simulations and the proposed methods are applied to the East Boston Asthma Study to detect prognostic factors leading to childhood asthma.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The authors investigated whether cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) had lived closer to one another at some time in life than individuals without sporadic CJD. Such a phenomenon would be compatible with some cases resulting from transmission. METHODS: UK sporadic CJD cases occurring from 1990 to 1998 were identified. Age-, sex- and hospital-matched controls were recruited. Lifetime residential histories were obtained by interview, usually with a proxy respondent. With use of Monte Carlo simulation, the residential proximity of cases during various time periods was compared with that expected in the absence of any clustering, using the information collected on the controls. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty sporadic CJD disease cases and 220 controls were included. Cases lived closer together than might be expected in the absence of any disease-clustering mechanism. This evidence became stronger as the critical period during which residential proximity was required to have occurred extended further into the past. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with some sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases resulting from exposure to a common external factor. The rarity of sporadic CJD suggests that repeated point-source outbreaks of infection are more likely to explain our observations than direct case-to-case transmission. Identifying sources of such outbreaks many years after the event will be extremely difficult.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Prediction intervals can be calculated for predicting cancer incidence on the basis of a statistical model. These intervals include the uncertainty of the parameter estimates and variations in future rates but do not include the uncertainty of assumptions, such as continuation of current trends. In this study we evaluated whether prediction intervals are useful in practice. METHODS: Rates for the period 1993-97 were predicted from cancer incidence rates in the five Nordic countries for the period 1958-87. In a Poisson regression model, 95\% prediction intervals were constructed for 200 combinations of 20 cancer types for males and females in the five countries. The coverage level was calculated as the proportion of the prediction intervals that covered the observed number of cases in 1993-97. RESULTS: Overall, 52\% (104/200) of the prediction intervals covered the observed numbers. When the prediction intervals were divided into quartiles according to the number of cases in the last observed period, the coverage level was inversely proportional to the frequency (84\%, 52\%, 46\% and 26\%). The coverage level varied widely among the five countries, but the difference declined after adjustment for the number of cases in each country. CONCLUSION: The coverage level of prediction intervals strongly depended on the number of cases on which the predictions were based. As the sample size increased, uncertainty about the adequacy of the model dominated, and the coverage level fell far below 95\%. Prediction intervals for cancer incidence must therefore be interpreted with caution.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>In recent years, small-area-based ecological regression analyses have been published that study the association between a health outcome and a covariate in several cities. These analyses have usually been performed independently for each city and have therefore yielded unrelated estimates for the cities considered, even though the same process has been studied in all of them. In this study, we propose a joint ecological regression model for multiple cities that accounts for spatial structure both within and between cities and explore the advantages of this model. The proposed model merges both disease mapping and geostatistical ideas. Our proposal is compared with two alternatives, one that models the association for each city as fixed effects and another that treats them as independent and identically distributed random effects. The proposed model allows us to estimate the association (and assess its significance) at locations with no available data. Our proposal is illustrated by an example of the association between unemployment (as a deprivation surrogate) and lung cancer mortality among men in 31 Spanish cities. In this example, the associations found were far more accurate for the proposed model than those from the fixed effects model. Our main conclusion is that ecological regression analyses can be markedly improved by performing joint analyses at several locations that share information among them. This finding should be taken into consideration in the design of future epidemiological studies.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {The threat of pandemics has made influenza surveillance systems a priority in epidemiology services around the world. The emergence of A-H1N1 influenza has required accurate surveillance systems in order to undertake specific actions only when and where they are necessary. In that sense, the main goal of this article is to describe a novel methodology for monitoring the geographical distribution of the incidence of influenza-like illness, as a proxy for influenza, based on information from sentinel networks. A Bayesian Poisson mixed linear model is proposed in order to describe the observed cases of influenza- like illness for every sentinel and week of surveillance. This model includes a spatio-temporal random effect that shares information in space by means of a kernel convolution process and in time by means of a first order autoregressive process. The extrapolation of this term to sites where information on incidence is not available will allow us to visualise the geographical distribution of the disease for every week of study. The following artcile shows the performance of this model in the Comunitat Valenciana’s Sentinel Network (one of the 17 autonomous regions of Spain) as a real case study of this methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {The European influenza surveillance scheme (EISS) is based on a surveillance model that combines clinical and virological data in the general population. Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68\%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe.},

The multivariate Poisson distribution can be regarded as the discrete counterpart of the multivariate normal distribution, which is suitable for modelling multivariate count data. Mixtures of multivariate Poisson distributions allow for overdispersion and for negative correlations between variables. To perform Bayesian analysis of these models we adopt a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with birth and death moves for updating the number of components. We present results obtained from applying our modelling approach to simulated and real data. Furthermore, we apply our approach to a problem in multivariate disease mapping, namely joint modelling of diseases with correlated counts.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an approach for correcting for interobserver measurement error in an ordinal logistic regression model taking into account also the variability of the estimated correc-tion terms. The different scoring behaviour of the 16 examiners complicated the identification of a geographical trend in a recent study on caries experience in Flemish children (Belgium) who were 7 years old. Since the measurement error is on the response the factor ‘examiner’ could be included in the regression model to correct for its confounding effect. However, controlling for examiner largely removed the geographical east–west trend. Instead, we suggest a (Bayesian) ordinal logistic model which corrects for the scoring error (compared with a gold standard) using a calibration data set.The marginal posterior distribution of the regression parameters of interest is obtained by integrating out the correction terms pertaining to the calibration data set. This is done by processing two Markov chains sequentially, whereby one Markov chain samples the correction terms. The sampled correction term is imputed in the Markov chain pertaining to the regression parameters. The model was fitted to the oral health data of the Signal–Tandmobiel ® study. A WinBUGS program was written to perform the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. AMarkov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal “slice” defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such “slice sampling” methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by “overrelaxation,” and for multivariate slice sampling by “reflection” from the edges of the slice.},

Bounds on the posterior probability of k components are derived using the constraints. Implications on prior distribution specification and on the adequacy of the posterior distribution of k as a tool for selecting an adequate number of components in the mixture are also explored.},

We use state of the art spatialtemporal models which can, we believe, anticipate various kinds of interactions and relations that might be present in the data. We use the traditional Poisson-normal model where, at any given time, the incidences of malaria for any two counties are conditionally independent and Poisson distributed with log-mean explained by rainfall and other fixed and random effects terms. Our methodological contribution is in allowing some of the random effects variances to evolve with time according to a dynamic model. Additionally, the change of support problem caused by combining malaria counts (per county) with rainfall (per station) is partially solved by interpolating the whole state through a Gaussian process. Posterior inference and model comparison are computationally assessed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), respectively.},

The different census tracts were grouped into three socioeconomic levels.

Although this is a widespread practice, this paper proves that the use of count data aggregated over time for disease mapping may give inappropriate area-specific relative risk. As a result, both decision-making and healthcare policies could be affected by inappropriate model specifications using aggregated information over time. The Poisson distribution properties were used in order to quantify the bias in area-specific relative risk estimation due to count data aggregated over time. A hierarchical Bayesian model with spatio-temporal random structure is proposed as an alternative to smoothing relative risk if the period of study need to span several years. Methods discussed in this paper were applied to a small-area survey on male mortality from all causes in Southern Spain for the period 1985–1999. The results suggest that particular caution should be taken when interpreting risk maps based on clustered annual data that use models with no temporal structure to smooth out the rates.},

The method was tried out on data sets of breast cancer and malignant melanoma patients from a population-based cancer registry. The performance of FB was compared with an ordinary Cox proportional hazard method. For both cancers both methods localized some areas of increased and some areas of decreased cancer-specific survival. The estimates provided by the Cox and the FB approach resembled each other, but the FB approach gave more geographical details. In particular, the boundaries of the clusters of high or low survival provided by the FB are more realistic.},

In the Bayesian framework, it is not pos- sible to perform a default statistical analysis of the mixture using an improper prior for the component parameters, since the posterior distribution does not exist. To overcome this dificulty, we propose use of the expected posterior prior approach of Pérez and Berger (1999). Besides providing suitable default priors for general mixture models, a key advantage of the use of expected posterior priors here is that they can be used in conjunction with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, even when the number of components is un- known. An application is considered involving Gamma Ray Bursts, modeled as arising from a bivariate normal mixture model with measurement errors on the observations.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION:In 2001, data from the California Cancer Registry suggested that breast cancer incidence rates among non-Hispanic white (nHW) women in Marin County, California, had increased almost 60% between 1991 and 1999. This analysis examines the extent to which these and other breast cancer incidence trends could have been impacted by bias in intercensal population projections. METHOD:We obtained population projections for the year 2000 projected from the 1990 census from the California Department of Finance (DOF) and population counts from the 2000 US Census for nHW women living in 10 California counties and quantified age-specific differences in counts. We also computed age-adjusted incidence rates of invasive breast cancer in order to examine and quantify the impact of differences between the population data sources. RESULTS:Differences between year 2000 DOF projections and year 2000 census counts varied by county and age and ranged from underestimates of 60% to overestimates of 64%. For Marin County, the DOF underestimated the number of nHW women aged 45 to 64 years by 32% compared to the 2000 US census. This difference produced a significant 22% discrepancy between breast cancer incidence rates calculated using the two population data sources. In Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties, DOF-based incidence rates were significantly lower than rates based on census data. Rates did not differ significantly by population data source in the remaining seven counties examined. CONCLUSION:Although year 2000 population estimates from the DOF did not differ markedly from census counts at the state or county levels, greater discrepancies were observed for race-stratified, age-specific groups within counties. Because breast cancer incidence rates must be calculated with age-specific data, differences between population data sources at the age-race level may lead to mis-estimation of breast cancer incidence rates in county populations affected by these differences, as was observed in Marin County. Although intercensal rates based on population projections are important for timely breast cancer surveillance, these rates are prone to bias due to the error of closure between population projections and decennial census population counts. Intercensal rates should be interpreted with this potential bias in mind.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have led to the enormous recent burgeoning of spatial-temporal databases and associated statistical modeling. Here we depart from the rather rich literature in space-time modeling by considering the setting where space is discrete (e.g., aggregated data over regions), but time is continuous. Our major objective in this application is to carry out inference on gradients of a temporal process in our data set of monthly county level asthma hospitalization rates in the state of California, while at the same time accounting for spatial similarities of the temporal process across neighboring counties. Use of continuous time models here allows inference at a finer resolution than at which the data are sampled. Rather than use parametric forms to model time, we opt for a more flexible stochastic process embedded within a dynamic Markov random field framework. Through the matrix-valued covariance function we can ensure that the temporal process realizations are mean square differentiable, and may thus carry out inference on temporal gradients in a posterior predictive fashion. We use this approach to evaluate temporal gradients where we are concerned with temporal changes in the residual and fitted rate curves after accounting for seasonality, spatiotemporal ozone levels and several spatially-resolved important sociodemographic covariates.},

Here, we try to combine both issues and present a joint analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of the risks of two related diseases processes–male and female lung cancer incidence–in a region of England. To do so, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model that splits the risk of disease into two spatio-temporal components: a shared component and a specific component that calibrates the differential between the two diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {There is currently much interest in conducting spatial analyses of health outcomes at the small-area scale. This requires sophisticated statistical techniques, usually involving Bayesian models, to smooth the underlying risk estimates because the data are typically sparse. However, questions have been raised about the performance of these models for recovering the “true” risk surface, about the influence of the prior structure specified, and about the amount of smoothing of the risks that is actually performed. We describe a comprehensive simulation study designed to address these questions. Our results show that Bayesian disease-mapping models are essentially conservative, with high specificity even in situations with very sparse data but low sensitivity if the raised-risk areas have only a moderate (< 2-fold) excess or are not based on substantial expected counts (> 50 per area). Semiparametric spatial mixture models typically produce less smoothing than their conditional autoregressive counterpart when there is sufficient information in the data (moderate-size expected count and/or high true excess risk). Sensitivity may be improved by exploiting the whole posterior distribution to try to detect true raised-risk areas rather than just reporting and mapping the mean posterior relative risk. For the widely used conditional autoregressive model, we show that a decision rule based on computing the probability that the relative risk is above 1 with a cutoff between 70 and 80% gives a specific rule with reasonable sensitivity for a range of scenarios having moderate expected counts (~ 20) and excess risks (~1.5- to 2-fold). Larger (3-fold) excess risks are detected almost certainly using this rule, even when based on small expected counts, although the mean of the posterior distribution is typically smoothed to about half the true value. Key words: Bayesian hierarchical models, cancer mapping, environmental epidemiology, sensitivity, small-area studies, spatial smoothing, specificity.},

  Abstract                 = {There is some evidence to suggest that the etiology of Hodgkin's disease includes an infectious component. One approach to investigating this possibility is a formal assessment of the geographic and temporal variation in the incidence of the disease. The present study was designed to better evaluate space-time patterns of residence prior to diagnosis of persons with Hodgkin's disease. Lifetime residential histories were obtained from 279 incident cases of Hodgkin's disease diagnosed between 1974 and 1982 in a defined population in northwestern Washington State, and a similar number of population controls matched to the cases by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. A method of point pattern analysis was modified for use in this context to compare the spatial proximity of case residences to that expected under the null assumption of no difference between the spatial pattern of case and control residences. Analyses were applied within temporal groupings of residences specified a priori assuming 1) no specified latency, 2) four different 5-year latent intervals, and 3) three age at exposure intervals. Assuming no latency, there is no evidence that case residences are more or less clustered than would be expected by chance. Assuming latent intervals of up to 15 years prior to diagnosis, case residences are less clustered than expected, particularly among those who developed Hodgkin's disease after the age of 40 years. In contrast, there is suggestive evidence that persons diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease after age 40 years lived closer together than expected as young children and teenagers. These results illustrate the need to focus such analyses on specific time intervals defined a priori to most likely represent periods of greatest etiologic relevance. To the extent that these findings are not the result of some unknown artifact of the method itself, they may serve to focus additional attention on childhood environment as a particularly important period in the etiology of this disease. Furthermore, the analytic method employed may be useful in identifying space-time clustering using population-based data in other etiologic settings.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the example of data on breast cancer survival in a specific area in France, this paper describes a Bayesian approach to analysing individual continuous-time spatially referenced survival data. Starting from the well-known Cox model we develop a geoadditive survival model with a baseline effect, spatial effects, age, period and cohort effects as well as the effect of the number of metastases at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, we also investigate temporal and spatial variations in the effect of the number of metastases. Our approach is particularly useful since we find clear hints for a violation of the proportional hazards assumption and the existence of different spatial patterns for patients with no, one and more than one metastasis. The reliability of our approach is attested by comparison with a parametric model and with several simulated data sets with known risk profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixture distributions are typically used to model data in which each observa-tion is assumed to have arisen from one of a number of different groups. They also provide a convenient and flexible class of models for density estimation. While a Bayesian analysis of mixture models has certain advantages over a classical approach, it is not without its problems. In theory quantities of inter-est may be written down as integrals, but in practice these integrals cannot be done analytically. When the number of groups in the data is assumed known, the Gibbs sampler can be used to perform this integration numerically, but the non-identifiability of the mixture model parameters causes label-switching in the Gibbs sampler output and makes inference for the individual components of the mixture meaningless. We show that the usual method of dealing with this problem (imposing simple identifiability constraints on the mixture model parameters) is sometimes inadequate, and present a more flexible approach to solving this prob-lem, which allows sensible clustering to be performed in a Bayesian context and allows interpretations for groups to be discovered rather than imposed. We illus-trate the success of our approach on several examples. When the number of groups in the data is considered unknown more sophis-ticated methods are required to perform the integration necessary for a Bayesian analysis. One method is described by Richardson and Green (1997), which they apply successfully to univariate data. We describe an alternative method which views the parameters of the model as a (marked) point process, extending meth-ods suggested by Ripley (1977) to create a Markov birth-death process with an appropriate stationary distribution. We apply this method successfully to both univariate and bivariate data. Finally we examine “on-line” methods for mixture models, in which the pos-terior distribution of the parameters is updated as observations arrive sequentially, and are then discarded. We show that the computationally trivial Quasi-Bayes method of Makov and Smith (1977) can be improved upon at the expense of small additional computational complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Richardson and Green (1997) present a method of performing a Bayesian analysis of data from a finite mixture distribution with an unknown number of components. Their method is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, which makes use of the “reversible jump” methodology described by Green (1995). We describe an alternative MCMC method which views the parameters of the model as a (marked) point process, extending methods suggested by Ripley (1977) to create a Markov birth-death process with an appropriate stationary distribution. Our method is easy to implement, even in the case of data in more than one dimension, and we illustrate it on both univariate and bivariate data. There appears to be considerable potential for applying these ideas to other contexts, as an alternative to more general reversible jump methods, and we conclude with a brief discussion of how this might be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The aim of the present paper was to analyse cancer mortality in the Umbria Region, from 1978 to 2004. Mortality trends depend on a number of factors including exposures, health system interventions, and possibly artefact (e.g. classification change, variations of data completeness). Descriptive data on mortality only allow for generation of hypotheses to explain observed trends. Some clues on the respective role of possible mortality determinants may be found comparing mortality with incidence and survival data. Methods Mortality data for the periods 1978-1993 and 1994-2004 were supplied by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Regional Causes of Death Registry (ReNCaM) respectively. Sex and site-specific mortality time trends were analysed by the joinpoint regression method. Results For all sites combined, in both sexes, the standardised rate was first increasing before the end of the eighties and decreasing thereafter. Gastric cancer mortality showed a different trend by gender; that is the rate constantly decreased over the period among females whereas, for males, it was first increasing up to 1985 and decreasing thereafter. Liver cancer trend showed a pattern similar to gastric cancer. Large bowel cancer showed a gender specific trend, that is it was increasing among males and stable among females. Also lung cancer mortality varied by gender: it started to decline after 1989 among males but was steadily increasing over the study period among women. A decreasing trend for female breast cancer mortality began in 1994. Prostate cancer mortality trend is the only one showing two significant joinpoints: mortality decreased up to 1990, then it increased up to 1998 and, finally, was decreasing. Conclusions Overall cancer mortality was decreasing in both sexes in Umbria and this favourable trend will probably continue and further improve since population screening against breast, cervix, and large bowel cancers were recently introduced. Besides gastric cancer, tobacco-related cancers and prostate cancer mainly contributed to mortality reduction in males, whereas breast cancer mainly contributed to declining mortality in females.},

The fundamentals of factor analysis with ideas of space— time disease mapping to provide a flexible framework for the joint analysis of multiple-related diseases in space and time with a view to estimating common and disease-specific trends in cancer risk are combined. The models are applied to area-level mortality data on six diet-related cancers for Greece over the 20-year period from 1980 to 1999. The aim of this study is to uncover the spatial and temporal patterns of any latent factor(s) underlying the cancer data that could be interpreted as reflecting some aspects of the habitual diet of the Greek population.},

The most limiting factors for the use of morbidity-data from practices in GIS-based mappings are differences which are not related to morbidity. These differences may be due to consultation behaviour, interpretation of the case definition, age distribution of patients and other reasons. In order to reduce the impact of these non-morbidity related differences on the interpretation, the data of many practices are usually pooled and consequently rather large areas are presented. Extracting and harmonising the signals for increased morbidity from practices is a presupposition for mapping with a sufficient geographical resolution. The possibility to harmonise by reducing those confounding differences on a practice level is investigated. Different harmonisation methods were applied to data from Germany where acute respiratory infections (ARI) per consultations are registered and from The Netherlands were influenza like illnesses (ILI) per population are registered. The harmonisation of the indices between countries was achieved by scaling them in relation to the level of the index representative for the peak activity during a usual influenza epidemic. The Kriging method is applied as a means of spatial prediction for the influenza data. The preliminary results are discussed with respect to resulting mappings.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The availability of geographic information from cancer and birth defect registries has increased public demands for investigation of perceived disease clusters. Many neighborhood-level cluster investigations are methodologically problematic, while maps made from registry data often ignore latency and many known risk factors. Population-based case-control and cohort studies provide a stronger foundation for spatial epidemiology because potential confounders and disease latency can be addressed. METHODS: We investigated the association between residence and colorectal, lung, and breast cancer on upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA) using extensive data on covariates and residential history from two case-control studies for 1983-1993. We generated maps using generalized additive models, smoothing on longitude and latitude while adjusting for covariates. The resulting continuous surface estimates disease rates relative to the whole study area. We used permutation tests to examine the overall importance of location in the model and identify areas of increased and decreased risk. RESULTS: Maps of colorectal cancer were relatively flat. Assuming 15 years of latency, lung cancer was significantly elevated just northeast of the Massachusetts Military Reservation, although the result did not hold when we restricted to residences of longest duration. Earlier non-spatial epidemiology had found a weak association between lung cancer and proximity to gun and mortar positions on the reservation. Breast cancer hot spots tended to increase in magnitude as we increased latency and adjusted for covariates, indicating that confounders were partly hiding these areas. Significant breast cancer hot spots were located near known groundwater plumes and the Massachusetts Military Reservation. DISCUSSION: Spatial epidemiology of population-based case-control studies addresses many methodological criticisms of cluster studies and generates new exposure hypotheses. Our results provide evidence for spatial clustering of breast cancer on upper Cape Cod. The analysis suggests further investigation of the potential association between breast cancer and pollution plumes based on detailed exposure modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {Joinpoint models have been applied to the cancer incidence and mortality data with continuous change points. The current estimation method [Lerman, P.M., 1980. Fitting segmented regression models by grid search. Appl. Statist. 29, 77-84] assumes that the joinpoints only occur at discrete grid points. However, it is more realistic that the joinpoints take any value within the observed data range. Hudson [1966. Fitting segmented curves whose join points have to be estimated. J. Amer. Statist. Soc. 61, 1097-1129] provides an algorithm to find the weighted least square estimates of the joinpoint on the continuous scale. Hudson described the estimation procedure in detail for a model with only one joinpoint, but its extension to a multiple joinpoint model is not straightforward. In this article, we describe in detail Hudson's method for the multiple joinpoint model and discuss issues in the implementation. We compare the computational efficiencies of the LGS method and Hudson's method. The comparisons between the proposed estimation method and several alternative approaches, especially the Bayesian joinpoint models, are discussed. Hudson's method is implemented by C++ and applied to the colorectal cancer incidence data for men under age 65 from SEER nine registries.},

  Abstract                 = {A Bayesian semi-parametric model is proposed to capture the interaction among demographic effects (age and gender), spatial effects (county) and temporal effects of colorectal cancer incidences simultaneously. In particular, an extension of multivariate conditionally autoregressive (CAR) processes to a partially informative Gaussian demographic spatial temporal CAR (DSTCAR) process for a spatial–temporal setting is proposed. The precision matrix of the Gaussian DSTCAR process is the Kronecker product of several components. The spatial component is modelled with a CAR prior. A pth order intrinsic autoregressive prior (IAR(p)) is implemented for the temporal component to estimate a smoothed and non-parametric temporal trend. The demographic component is modelled with a Wishart prior. Data analysis shows significant spatial correlation only exists in the age group of 50–59. Males and females in their 50s and 60s show fairly strong correlation. The hypothesis testing based on Bayes factor suggests that gender correlation cannot be ignored in this model.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: When the subjects are children, the assessment of social class must be made indirectly from parental data. We propose correspondence analysis as a method for combining parental information. METHODS: Four assessment methods were used: father's occupation, mother's occupation, dominant occupation of both, and both combined by means of a correspondence analysis. The results were used to explore social inequalities in dental health. We used data from a survey performed on school children (12- and 15-16-year olds) in the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain). Dental health was measured through prevalence of caries, number of teeth with caries, number of caries in permanent teeth, decayed, missing, and filled teeth score (DMF-T), decayed, missing, and filled surface score (DMF-S), prevalence of DMF>0, community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) and prevalence of CPITN>0. RESULTS: Correspondence analysis methods reflect the impact of social class on health indicators. They were able to assign a social group to all individuals. The association between social class and oral health was found to be sensitive to the method used. CONCLUSIONS: Pooling information from both parents is important. Evidence of social inequalities in oral health may or may not be obtained depending on the method used.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The Comunitat Valenciana (CV) is a tourist region on the Mediterranean coast of Spain with a high rate of retirement migration. Lung cancer in women is the cancer mortality cause that has increased most in the CV during the period 1991 to 2000. Moreover, the geographical distribution of risk from this cause in the CV has been previously described and a non-homogenous pattern was determined. The present paper studies the spatio-temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality for women in the CV during the period 1987-2004, in order to gain some insight into the factors, such as migration, that have had an influence on these changes. Methods A novel methodology, consisting of a Bayesian hierarchical model, is used in this paper. Such a model allows the handling of data with a very high disaggregation, while at the same time taking advantage of its spatial and temporal structure. Results The spatio-temporal pattern which was found points to geographical differences in the time trends of risk. In fact, the southern coastal side of the CV has had a higher increase in risk, coinciding with the settlement of a large foreign community in that area, mainly comprised of elderly people from the European Union. Conclusions Migration has frequently been ignored as a risk factor in the description of the geographical risk of lung cancer and it is suggested that this factor should be considered, especially in tourist regions. The temporal component in disease mapping provides a more accurate depiction of risk factors acting on the population.},
